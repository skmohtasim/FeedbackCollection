# FeedbackCollection
1. Create a database in MSSQL Server naming "FeedbackCollection".
2. Execute the script in DBScript forlder of file "DB Script.sql".
3. Change connection server in AppSettings.json file of "FCConnection" node.
4. Due to lack of time couldn't complete the project. Tried to focus on project structure and database structure. Only json response can be found in the project. 
	So please set FeedbackCollection.API project as start up project and run the project.
